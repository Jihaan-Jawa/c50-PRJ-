  <h1> What do I believe that how my nature is not important but its important what do good and intelligent people believe  about me.<br/>
    So, According to me :-<br/>
    I am some times lazy ,<br/>
    If a person irritates me by any irrelevant way such as teasing me or chasing me so that time I am very angry and cantankerous.<br/>
    I love dogs (not that one who barks extremly one only cute and sweet),<br/>
    I love chubby kids .<br/>
